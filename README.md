Clone this git repository to your machine/container that has access to your minecraft server folders. <br>

For web interface you need to install [mcsw](https://github.com/MertDalbudak/mcsw) first.

Run the `bin/setup` script on Debian based environments and follow the instructions.
For Alpine environment run the `bin/setup-alpine` shell script.
After the setup is complete reboot your system. `mcsm` will be started as a daemon when your system boots up.

Currently only Java Minecraft Servers are supported. Bedrock will follow as soon as possible.
