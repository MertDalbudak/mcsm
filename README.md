# Installation

Clone this git repository to your machine/container that has access to your minecraft server folders.
Run the `bin/setup` script in your Debian based environment and follow the instructions.

If the installation script indicates an error while running you might run `npm i` as well.

After the setup is complete you can start your mcsm server with the following command.

`systemctl start mcsm.service`

Currently only Java Minecraft Servers are supported. Bedrock will follow as soon as possible.
