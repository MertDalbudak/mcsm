# Installation

Clone this git repository to your machine/container that has access to your minecraft server folders.
Run the `bin/setup` script in your Debian based environment and follow the instructions.
After the setup is complete you can start your mcsm server with the following command.

If the installation script indicates an error while running you might run `npm i` as well.

`systemctl start mcsm.service`

Currently only Java Minecraft Servers are supported. Bedrock will follow as soon as possible.
